- Dear Sun and Sister

  The sand and the time inside it,          <br>
  nothing of False will be changed in True, <br>
  if True,                                  <br>
  this could be convenient for us.

  It depends from which eyes We are looking.

  If you want to meet the stars,     <br>
  maybe the sky gave you this desire;

  On the shining days as it should be, <br>
  you will receive a gift,             <br>
  a positive point of view.

  When a moon merges with the true life, <br>
  to be the sun,                         <br>
  another moon prepares herself to be,   <br>
  the best partner of night.

  Like we have done more time ago,         <br>
  this Cycle makes a question to all of us,

  is that all we have, a Circle ? <br>
  Not, of sure.                   <br>
  We are over, the infinity!
