telemetry - wiki
Telemetry is the in situ collection of measurements or other data at remote points,
and their automatic transmission to receiving equipment (telecommunication) for monitoring.
The word is derived from the Greek roots tele, 'remote', and metron, 'measure'.
Systems that need external instructions and data to operate require the counterpart of telemetry.
